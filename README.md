Cleaning Weather Data with Apache Spark 

While taking the "Apache Spark with Scala - Hands On with Big Data!" course on Udemy provided by Sundog Education, I wanted to dive a little deeper to make sure I was understanding the concepts. In this project I focused on utilizing datasets and Spark SQL functionality. 

Being an avid snowboarder, the precipitation and snowfall in the Colorado front range are things that I probably pay too much attention to. I figure'd why not clean up some weather data for the town of Steamboat Springs, home to one of my favorite resorts. I was able to find some really cool weather data for the town dating back to the early 1900's. Unfortunately the data had a large amount of missing data and questionable "T" measurements in the Snow column. In order to eventually run further analysis and some basic machine learning models in a later project, I first wanted to clean the data. 

You'll be able to find my main scala script here: "Steamboat Weather\src\main\scala\com\weather\spark"

I have also included the project folder including libraries that I used during the process. 

Stay tuned for further analysis of the data!
